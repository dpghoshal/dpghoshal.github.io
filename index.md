I completed my PhD in Fall 2021 from the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/"><strong>McGill University</strong></a>. My thesis topic was “Finite-interval estimation using double-sided kernels and differential invariants”. My PhD was funded by the <a href="https://mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/meda/named-fellowships/trottier">Lorne Trottier Engineering Graduate Fellowship</a>, the <a href="https://mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/meda/named-fellowships/geoff-hyland">Geoff Hyland Fellowship in Engineering</a>, and the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/gef">Graduate Excellence Fellowship</a> through the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/meda">McGill Engineering Doctoral Award</a>. During my PhD, I published nine <a href="publications">peer-reviewed papers</a> in some of the leading conferences such as American Control Conference (ACC), World Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC), etc. I also mentored a group of Master's students, resulting in multiple collaborative publications.

<p>
From 2018 to 2020, I also worked part-time at <a href="https://www.aerial.ai"><strong>Aerial Technologies</strong></a> — first as a Research Scientist Intern, then as an independent Research Scientist Consultant — where I applied Feature Engineering in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning to solve practical problems.

<p>
I completed my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/"><strong>Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</strong></a> in 2014. My thesis topic was “Robot Learning from a Human Expert through Modified Kinesthetic Teaching”.
</p>
     
<p>
I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/"><strong>Jadavpur University</strong></a> in 2011. My elective was Control Systems Engineering.
