I am pursuing my PhD in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/) at [**McGill University**](https://www.mcgill.ca/). My research area is Control Systems Engineering, and my current work focuses on estimator design. I am advised by Prof. Hannah Michalska. My PhD is funded by the [Lorne Trottier Engineering Graduate Fellowship](https://mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/meda/named-fellowships/trottier), the [Geoff Hyland Fellowship in Engineering](https://mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/meda/named-fellowships/geoff-hyland), and the [Graduate Excellence Fellowship](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/gef) through the [McGill Engineering Doctoral Award](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/graduate-students/funding/meda).

Currently I am also working at [**Aerial Technologies**](https://www.aerial.ai) as a Research Scientist Intern, where I get to apply my domain knowledge of Systems Theory to solve practical problems in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning.

I completed my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [**Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2014. My thesis topic was “Robot Learning from a Human Expert through Modified Kinesthetic Teaching”. I was advised by Prof. Laxmidhar Behera.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [**Jadavpur University**](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/) in 2011. My elective was Control Systems Engineering.
