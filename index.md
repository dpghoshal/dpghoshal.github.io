I am pursuing my PhD in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/) at [**McGill University**](https://www.mcgill.ca/).  
My supervisor is Prof. Hannah Michalska.  
My research area is Control Systems.

Currently I am also working at [**Aerial Technologies**](https://www.aerial.ai) as a Research Scientist Intern, where I get to apply my domain knowledge of Systems Theory to solve practical Machine Learning problems.

I completed my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [**Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2014.  
My thesis topic was “Robot Learning from a Human Expert through Modified Kinesthetic Teaching”.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [**Jadavpur University**](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/) in 2011.
